1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,640
Cancer is a creepy and mysterious thing.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,100
In the process of trying to understand it,

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,720
to get better at killing it,

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:12,180
we discovered a biological paradox
that remains unsolved to this day:

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,920
Large animals seem to be immune to cancer,

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,600
which doesn't make any sense.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,620
The bigger a being, the more cancer it should have.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,760
To understand why we first need to
take a look at the nature of cancer itself.

9
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,960
(Kurzgesagt intro music)

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,820
Kurzgesagt in a Nutshell

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,180
Our cells are protein robots made out
of hundreds of millions of parts.

12
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,140
Guided only by chemical reactions,

13
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,900
they create and dismantle structures,

14
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,280
sustain a metabolism to gain energy,

15
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,240
or make *almost* perfect copies of themselves.

16
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,120
We call these complex chemical reactions pathways.

17
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:59,200
They are biochemical networks upon networks,
intertwined and stacked on top of each other.

18
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,500
Most of them can barely be comprehended by
a single human mind and yet they functioned perfectly...

19
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,520
Until.. they don't.

20
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:13,440
With billions of trillions of reactions happening
in thousands of networks over many years,

21
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:17,140
The question is not *if* something
will go wrong, but when.

22
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,880
Tiny mistakes add up until the
grandiose machinery gets corrupted.

23
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,320
To prevent this from getting out of hand,

24
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,880
our cells have kill switches that
make them commit suicide.

25
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,420
But these kill switches are not infallible.

26
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,580
If they fail, a cell can turn into a cancer cell.

27
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,220
Most of them are slained by
the immune system very quickly.

28
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,380
But this is a numbers game.

29
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:46,420
Given enough time a cell would accrue enough mistakes, slipped by unnoticed and begin making more of itself.

30
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,440
All animals have to deal with this problem.

31
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,800
In general the cells of different
animals are the same size.

32
00:01:54,100 --> 00:02:00,180
The cells of a mouse aren't smaller than yours.
It just has fewer cells in total and a shorter lifespan.

33
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,860
Fewer cells and a short life means a lower chance
of things going wrong or cells mutating,

34
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,980
or at least it should mean that.

35
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:14,360
Humans live about 50 times longer and
have 3!,000 times more cells than mice,

36
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,360
yet the rate of cancer is basically
the same in humans and in mice.

37
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:25,300
Even waiter, blue whales with about 3,000 times more cells than humans don't seem to get cancer at all really.

38
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,160
This is PETO'S PARADOX:

39
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,720
The baffling realization that large animals
have much much less cancer than they should.

40
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:40,100
Scientists think there are two main ways of
explaining the paradox; evolution and hyper tumors.

41
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:44,380
Solution one: evolve or become a blob of cancer.

42
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,100
As multicellular beings
developed a 600 million years ago,

43
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,420
animals became bigger and bigger.

44
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:56,800
Which added more and more cells and hence more
and more chances that cells could be corrupted.

45
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,180
So the collective had to invest
in better and better cancer defenses.

46
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,520
The ones that did not died out.

47
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,680
But cancer doesn't just happen.

48
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:12,720
It's a process that involves many individual mistakes and mutations in several specific genes within the same cell.

49
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:18,560
These genes are called proto-oncogenes
and when they mutate it's bad news.

50
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,140
For example with the right mutation,
a cell will lose its ability to kill itself.

51
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,080
Another mutation and it will develop the ability to hide.

52
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,260
Another and it will send out calls for resources.

53
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,880
Another one and it will multiply quickly.

54
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,240
These oncogenes have an antagonist though;

55
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,100
tumor suppressor genes.

56
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:45,940
They prevent these critical mutations from happening or order the cell to kill itself if they decide it's beyond repair.

57
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,540
It turns out that large animals
have an increased number of them.

58
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,940
Because of this, elephant cells require more
mutations than mice cells to develop a tumor.

59
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,060
They are not immune but more resilient.

60
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:04,020
This adaption probably comes with a cost in
some form but researchers still aren't sure what it is.

61
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:10,420
Maybe tumor suppressors make elephants age quicker later in life or slow down how quickly injuries heal.

62
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,100
We don't know yet.

63
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,120
But the solution to the paradox
may actually be something different.

64
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,519
"Hypertumors"

65
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,880
Solution 2:  Hypertumors

66
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,700
Solution 2: Hypertumors
(Yes)

67
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,520
Solution 2: Hypertumors
(Yes, really.)

68
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:28,120
Hypertumors are named after
hyperparasites: the parasites of parasites.

69
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,980
Hypertumors are the tumors of tumors.

70
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,260
Cancer can be thought of as
a breakdown in cooperation.

71
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:40,640
Normally, cells work together to form structures like organs, tissue or elements of the immune system.

72
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,560
But cancer cells are selfish and only work for their own short-term benefit.

73
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:51,360
If they're successful, they form tumors;
huge cancer collectives that can be very hard to kill.

74
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,480
Making a tumor is hard work though.

75
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,480
Millions or billions of cancer cells multiply rapidly,
which requires a lot of resources and energy.

76
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:05,640
The amount of nutrients they can steal from
the body becomes the limiting factor for growth.

77
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:12,240
So the tumor cells trick the body to build new blood vessels directly to the tumor, to feed the thing killing it.

78
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,840
And here, the nature of cancer cells
may become their own undoing.

79
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:22,360
Cancer cells are inherently unstable
and so they can continue to mutate.

80
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,440
Some of them faster than their buddies.

81
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,540
If they do this for a while,

82
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:30,500
at some point one of the copies of
the copies of the original cancer cell,

83
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:35,060
might suddenly think of itself as an
individual again and stop cooperating.

84
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,420
Which means just like the body,

85
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,140
the original tumor suddenly becomes an enemy,

86
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,260
fighting for the same scarce nutrients and resources.

87
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:47,520
So the newly mutated cells can create a hypertumor.

88
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,780
Instead of helping, they cut off the
blood supply to their former buddies,

89
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,000
which will starve and kill the original cancer cells.

90
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,060
Cancer is killing cancer.

91
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,200
This process can repeat over and over,

92
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,300
and this may prevent cancer from
becoming a problem for a large organism.

93
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:09,240
It is possible that large animals have
more of these hyper tumors than we realize,

94
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,520
they might just not become big enough to notice

95
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:16,380
Which makes sense a two gram tumor
is 10% of a mouse's body weight,

96
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,080
while It's less than 0.002% of a human

97
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,600
and 0.000002% of a blue whale.

98
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,700
All three tumors require the same number of
cell divisions and have the same number of cells.

99
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,480
So an old blue whale might be filled
with tiny cancers and just not care.

100
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,060
There are other proposed solutions to Peto's paradox,

101
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,800
such as different metabolic rates

102
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,760
or different cellular architecture.

103
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,720
But right now we just don't know.

104
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,900
Scientists are working on the problem.

105
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:51,300
Figuring out how large animals are so resilient
to one of the most deadly diseases we know,

106
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,320
could open the path to new therapies and treatments.

107
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,000
Cancer has always been a challenge.

108
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,460
Today, we are finally beginning to understand it

109
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,500
and by doing so, one day we might finally overcome it.
